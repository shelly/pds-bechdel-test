    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since movies have become so instrumental in influencing viewersâ€™ opinions, it is crucial to ensure that the messages they send across, are the sort we want to see in our society. As we read more about movies and social issues related to them, we grew increasingly interested in gender bias and how it is monitored and measured in the film industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found some [shocking statistics](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html). In 2014, globally:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There were __2.24 male characters__ for every __1 female character__.\n",
    "* __23.3%__ of films surveyed had a female lead or co-lead.\n",
    "* Females comprised __7% of directors__, __19.7% of writers__, and __22.7% of producers__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bechdel Test\n",
    "More research led us to a metric known as the Bechdel Test. The Bechdel Test is a test originally proposed in 1985 by Alison Bechdel that is used to \"grade\" movies on their representation of women. \n",
    "\n",
    "The movie needs to pass the following criteria\n",
    "1. Have at least two named women in it\n",
    "2. Who talk to each other\n",
    "3. About something besides a man\n",
    "\n",
    "A film is given a score between 0-3 based on how many of the Bechdel Test criteria it satisfies. For example, a film with no women characters gets a score of 0, a film with two named women who do not speak to each other gets a 1, and a film with at least two women who talk to each other about a man would receive a 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The test itself has been in question as a metric for gender bias - is it accurate, sufficient and indicative of equal representation of women in film? \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we found it interesting that the movie Gravity (starring Sandra Bullock) fails the test, even though Sandra Bullock, the protagonist, has an extremely developed plotline and background. The issue was that there were no other women in the movie, and so there was no way it would satisfy the Bechdel Test criteria. On the other hand, the blockbuster Titanic is a movie about Kate Winslet's journey and her growing into herself, but the movie passes because of conversations between her mother and her friends gossiping about another female character. We felt that this movie passed for the _wrong_ reasons, because the scene for which it passed the test involved demeaning a woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __two key questions__ we wanted to answer for our project were: \n",
    "1. What makes a movie likely to pass or fail the Bechdel test? \n",
    "2. Is the Bechdel test a good metric for evaluating female representation?"

    "## Dataset\n",
    "###  Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a [website](https://bechdeltest.com/) with a crowd-sourced list of movies and their Bechdel test scores. We used their API to create a CSV file of ~7500 movies and their Bechdel test scores. The API also provided each movie's IMDB ID, the unique identifier for each movie on [IMDB.com](http://www.imdb.com). This was useful for combining this data with other information about the movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since IMDB does not provide a public API, we used an API provided by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en) (TMDB) to get details about each movie's production and success. We used the API to connect a movie's IMDB ID to its TMDB ID, and then sent requests to endpoints to get each movie's details, credits, and similar movies that TMDB would recommend to someone who liked it. We then went through each movie's first ten cast members, directors, and writers and send requests to obtain their details. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset about movies is hosted [here](https://github.com/shelly/pds-bechdel-test/blob/master/movies.csv), generated by our code available [here](https://github.com/shelly/pds-bechdel-test/blob/master/get_movies.py).\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "We were able to train a relatively successful SVM model with our engineered features. SVMs attempt to linearly separate the data that they are given, so our model's success means that it found a combination of features that would easily separate movies that pass the Bechdel Test from movies that do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings also indicate that clusters of movies tend to all pass or fail the test together. For example, movies that have at least one female writer are all likely to pass, and the cluster of movies that are Westerns are all likely to fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we found multiple features that correlate to whether or not a movie will pass the Bechdel test, including: having at least one female writer, having a female director, being more recent, having a female lead, and belonging to certain genres. Our work supports the hypothesis that the Bechdel test is a good baseline metric for female representation. Many of our features were intentionally engineered to reflect real-world approaches to improving female representation, such as hiring female writers or having a larger percentage of female cast and crew. However, as mentioned before, the fact that Gravity does not pass, but Titanic does, raises doubt in our minds as to whether the test always captures the spirit of female representation in movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work and Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest evaluating other methods of measuring female representation in a similar manner to our analysis, to find metrics that improve upon the Bechdel Test. One such method is the [Mako Mori Test](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Mako_Mori_test). In a [study by FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/), numerous female current writers, directors and actors were asked to reflect on the Bechdel Test and suggest improvements and alternatives, all of which also seem worth formally evaluating.\n",
    "\n",
    "A logical next step to further investigating gender bias in movies would be analyze movie scripts or plot overviews, to automatically assess how well-rounded female characters are based on their occupations, actions, and dialogue, such as in this [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/madaan18a/madaan18a.pdf)."
